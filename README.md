# Ticketing_System
This project emulates a ticket selection system

This is a stripped down version of a selection system

Class TicketSelector has two main functionalities:
1. addPerson(String name, int tickets) which adds the person specified into the draw based on their specified number of tickets
2. selection(int picks) which selects the specified number of people from the draw -> selectioin ensures that no person can be chosen twice in the same selection process and the people who have been drawn will be guaranteed not to be drawn in the next selection

I have also provided a sample application that runs the selection system
